# Home Exercise: Using AI to Develop an Architecture - the Embedding Approach

## Exercise Context

**Exercise ID:** ArchitectureDevelopment02
**Type:** Home Exercise
**Topic:** AI-Assisted Architecture Development

## Task

Use AI embeddings and vector databases to cluster EarlyBird functional requirements into an architecture proposal for the application core.

## The Approach

1. **Feed embeddings** of the functional EarlyBird requirements into a vector database
2. **Have the database cluster** the requirements based on semantic similarity
3. **The result is - almost - an architecture proposal** for the application core
   - Each component should implement one of those requirement clusters
   - Find good names for the clusters = components

## Example Requirements (to be clustered)

- "The lion sleeps tonight."
- "The tiger hunts all day."
- "Johann Sebastian Bach lived from 1685 to 1750."

The AI will cluster semantically related requirements together, suggesting natural component boundaries.

## What You'll Learn

- How AI embeddings can discover natural system boundaries
- Using vector databases for requirement clustering
- Mapping requirement clusters to architectural components
- The relationship between semantic similarity and component cohesion

## Note

"The lion sleeps tonight" is actually a reference to the famous song, showing how diverse requirements can be organized by meaning rather than syntax.
