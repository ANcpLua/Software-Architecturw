# Evening 3 - Architecture Development

**Theme:** Systematic Development of Architecture from Requirements
**PDF:** `1_Architecture_Development_V702.pdf`

This evening teaches how to derive architecture from requirements using SE4-methods, service elicitation, application cores, and AI-assisted clustering.

## Exercises Overview

| ExID | Folder | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Dis*Ease01 | [01-disease-architecture-from-class-diagram](01-disease-architecture-from-class-diagram/) | Architecture from domain model (hospital system) |
| ArchDev02 | [02-ai-driven-requirement-clustering](02-ai-driven-requirement-clustering/) | Embedding-based automatic architecture derivation |
| Mars02 | [03-mars-application-core](03-mars-application-core/) | Very small, pure Application Core design |
| EarlyBird12 | [04-earlybird-application-core](04-earlybird-application-core/) | Larger Application Core — EarlyBird architecture |
| MateMate02 | [05-matemate-service-based-architecture](05-matemate-service-based-architecture/) | Blood Types (A/T/0), Allowed-To-Use matrix |
| — | [matemate-service-elicitation-results](matemate-service-elicitation-results/) | Service elicitation phase results (10 services) |

## Learning Objectives

- Determine subsystems using **Service Elicitation → Subsystem Establishment**
- Apply **A/T/0 blood type architecture model**
- Design **Application Cores** (small → large)
- Use **requirements embeddings** for clustering
- Perform architecture evaluation with change impact matrices

---

## Required Case Studies

- `earlybird-requirements-v150.pdf`
- EarlyBird system requirements

---

## Notes

- Complete **Mars02 before EarlyBird12** — the small application core is the conceptual foundation.
- Embedding-based clustering (ArchDev02) shows AI4SE in practice.
- MateMate02 bridges classical architecture methods and modern AI-based tooling.
