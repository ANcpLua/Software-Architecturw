# MateMate: Results of Service Elicitation

## Exercise Context

**Exercise:** MateMate Service Elicitation Results
**Type:** Group Exercise
**Evening:** 3
**Topic:** SE4 Method - Service Elicitation Phase

## Context

After the brainstorming workshop for the MateMate chess application, you've identified the services that subsystems will
need to provide to each other and to actors.

## Services Identified

1. On which screen position did the most recent mouse click take place?
2. What is the optimal move in the following situation: (chess position)?
3. Draw a white pawn (*Bauer*) on c4
4. To which squares may a rook (*Turm*) at a5 move?
5. Draw a black dot at position (898, 266)
6. Draw the following chess position: (position diagram)
7. What is the value for white in the following situation: (position)? This is the above-mentioned value service
8. Is white checkmated?
9. Whose turn is it to move?
10. How many points is a rook (*Turm*) worth in the value service?

## Next Steps in SE4

After **Service Elicitation**, continue with:

- **Subsystem Establishment** - Map services to subsystems
- **System Explanation** - Create architecture views
- **System Evaluation** - Review with checklists and scenarios

## What You'll Learn

- How to identify services from requirements
- Service-oriented thinking in architecture
- Translation between German chess terms (Bauer=Pawn, Turm=Rook) and technical services
- The relationship between user actions and system services
