   - Describes MateMate chess application
   - You are chief architect of Queen&King Inc.
   - MateMate plays against human opponent (drag & drop moves)
   - Thinks ahead and evaluates positions with numerical scores
   - Optimal move calculation and chess piece movement

## Exercise Context

**Exercise ID:** MateMate02
**Evening:** 3
**Type:** Group
**PDF:** Pages 43-48 in Architecture Development slides

**Task:** Apply SE4 method to MateMate chess application.

**SE4 Steps:**
1. **Service Elicitation** - List services provided by subsystems to each other and to actors
2. **Subsystem Establishment** - Map services to subsystems, determine "blood types" (A/T/0)
3. **System Explanation** - Create views/models/diagrams describing the architecture
4. **System Evaluation** - Perform checklist-based and scenario-based review

**Blood Types:**
- **A-Type** (Application Core) - Stable business logic
- **T-Type** (Technology) - Volatile infrastructure
- **0-Type** (Other) - External systems, libraries

**Deliverable:** Allowed-to-use specification showing which subsystems can depend on which.
